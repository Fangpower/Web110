                <p>
                    Web games are a simple and easy way to play video games on the internet without having to download anything. 
                    You can go to any of many websites and play an the game you want from a nearly endless selection. 
                    While you wonâ€™t get the Triple A graphics of a downloadable game many of the web games still have excellent visuals and performance. 
                    There are many popular single player games, but web games really shine with multiplayer games. 
                    Playing one of the many silly multiplayer games is a great way to kill time with friends. 
                    There are thousands upon thousands of games available to play online today.
