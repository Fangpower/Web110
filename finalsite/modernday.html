                    Today you can play web games on many different websites. 
                    While there is often overlap each site has unique games for everyone.
                    These websites can offer players these games for free by showing advertisements on the page. 
                    Many sites allow users to pay so they can hide the advertisements. 
                    Players can also create their accounts on some sites to save their data for some games. 
                    This allows players to easily play games whenever they want without the hassle of downloading the game.

                    Many of these sites had games made with flash that became unplayable when flash got discontinued. 
                    However, emulators were created and have been able to bring these games back from the brink. 
                    This is a list of some of the largest websites today that host thousands of games. 
                    They can achieve this by allowing developers to upload their games to the sites and make money off of the adverts shown to players. 
                    While some websites only offer a few high-quality games, sites like Kongregate have over 100,000 games for players to explore.
