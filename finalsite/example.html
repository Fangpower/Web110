                <p>There are two main ways to add a game to your website today. 
                    One method is to set up your own script that allows the games zip file to be run from your website. 
                    An easier and far quicker way to do this however is to let another website handle running your game. 
                    You can then embed the game into your website in a method called iframe. 
                    The iframe can be used for other purposes as well. 
                    It creates a window within your website that displays content from another website, making it work especially well for web games.
