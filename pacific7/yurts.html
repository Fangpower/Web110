                    <h3>What is a yurt?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our luxury uurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground.
                        Each yurt is fully encolsed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.

                    <h3>How are the yurts furnished?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove.
                        Your luxury camping experience includes electicity and a sink with hot and cold running water. 
                        Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

                    <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing.
                        It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
